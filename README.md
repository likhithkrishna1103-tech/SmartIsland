## Overview

Smart Island is an open-source Android app that adds a small animated pill near the status bar. It listens for notification events locally, groups active items, and expands into a richer view for quick actions, media details, incoming calls, and notification previews.

The project is designed to be transparent, hackable, and privacy-conscious: notification data is processed on the device, settings are stored locally, and the app currently does not request the Android `INTERNET` permission.

## Downloads & Safety

* **Download APK**: Obtain the pre-compiled application package directly from the [GitHub Releases (Latest)](https://github.com/agupta07505/SmartIsland/releases/latest) page.
* **Total Downloads**: ![Total Downloads](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/agupta07505/SmartIsland/total?color=2ea44f&logo=github)
* **Security Verification**: To ensure transparency and safety, you can inspect the files using [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com) or review the automatic building and packaging logs under the GitHub Actions tab.

## Features

| Area | What Smart Island does |
| --- | --- |
| Floating overlay | Draws a compact island above other apps using Android's overlay window APIs. |
| Notification listener | Converts active notifications into glanceable island cards. |
| Smooth animation | Morphs between collapsed and expanded states with Compose animations. |
| Multiple notifications | Keeps a stack of active notifications and lets users move between them. |
| Calls and media | Detects incoming calls, music/media sessions, artwork, playback state, and progress. |
| Battery charging | Displays charging percentage, pulsing charging icon, and remaining charge time estimates. |
| Quick actions | Opens, dismisses, or launches supported notification content from the expanded island. |
| Custom controls | Lets users adjust width, height, position, and corner radius. |
| Local settings | Persists island preferences with AndroidX DataStore Preferences. |
| Demo modes | Includes notification, call, music, and battery charging demo buttons for quick testing. |

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Tools |
| --- | --- |
| Language | Kotlin |
| UI | Jetpack Compose, Material 3 |
| Android services | `NotificationListenerService`, foreground service, `WindowManager` overlay |
| State and storage | Kotlin coroutines, StateFlow, AndroidX DataStore Preferences |
| Build | Gradle Wrapper, Android Gradle Plugin, JVM 17 |

## Requirements

- Android Studio with Android SDK 36 installed
- JDK 17
- Android device or emulator running Android 8.0+ (`minSdk 26`)
- Overlay permission enabled on the test device
- Notification listener access enabled for Smart Island

## Getting Started

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/agupta07505/SmartIsland.git
cd SmartIsland
```

Build a debug APK on Windows:

```powershell
.\gradlew.bat assembleDebug
```

Build a debug APK on macOS or Linux:

```bash
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

Install the debug build on a connected device:

```bash
./gradlew installDebug
```

Then open Smart Island and complete the runtime setup:

1. Grant overlay permission.
2. Enable notification listener access.
3. Turn on Smart Island from the app.
4. Use the demo buttons or trigger real notifications to test the island.

## Privacy And Permissions

Smart Island needs powerful Android permissions because it is an overlay and notification experience. The project keeps that behavior visible and local.

| Permission | Why it is used |
| --- | --- |
| `SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW` | Draws the floating island above other apps. |
| `BIND_NOTIFICATION_LISTENER_SERVICE` | Reads notification metadata so the island can show notification, call, and media states. |
| `FOREGROUND_SERVICE` and `FOREGROUND_SERVICE_SPECIAL_USE` | Keeps the overlay service running while the island is enabled. |

At the time of this README, the app does not request `INTERNET`, does not include analytics, and does not send notification content to a remote server. See [PRIVACY.md](PRIVACY.md) for the full privacy note.

## Development Notes

- Use the Gradle Wrapper committed in this repository.
- Keep secrets, keystores, local SDK paths, generated APKs, and personal notification screenshots out of git.
- Test overlay behavior on a physical device when possible; OEM Android builds can handle overlay and background-service rules differently.
- Some floating-window behavior depends on Android version and device support.
- The pass-through touch region and freeform "open in floating window" gesture rely on best-effort platform APIs and may be unavailable on some devices/OEM Android builds.
- For signed GitHub Actions releases, see [docs/RELEASE_SIGNING.md](docs/RELEASE_SIGNING.md).
